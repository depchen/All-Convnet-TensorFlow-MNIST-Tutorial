# All-Convnet-TensorFlow-MNIST-Tutorial
A look at using conv nets all the way through for TensorFlows MNIST Tutorial

# Why All-Convnet
Recently I read the paper Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net [blup](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806.pdf). It seems based on this and similar papers I have looked at that Neural Networks might be heading to the all Conv architecture (for some image stuff). I wanted to play around with them a bit so I re-wrote the TensorFlow MNIST tutorial with the same general design as seen in the above paper. I thought it would be funny if this new approach, which is arguably much simpler, would compare to the standard MNIST tutorial.

# Results
Arg me have no GPU till tomorrow.
